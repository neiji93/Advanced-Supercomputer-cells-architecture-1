Supercomputer cells architecture 1

we can start with : exp(2980x) = ln(20y) because maths are large scale world and with this formula, we can extend something simple to a next corresponding complicated form of maths. I hope that there is ways. At the moment, I don't know which way I can use. I used to many times physics then I hope to use pure maths too or physics fatally. May be used as CGI tools !
