Supercomputer cells architecture 1

we can start with : exp(2980x) = ln(20y) because maths are large scale world and with this formula, we can extend something simple to a next corresponding complicated form of maths. I hope that there is ways. At the moment, I don't know which way I can use. I used to many times physics then I hope to use pure maths too or physics fatally. May be used as CGI tools ! Then, with that knowledge, it is sure that we can use local models because I used models in my first chess engine (the one which doesn't use a supercomputer cell).I don't know what is local models but, so, non verified models with log(x) can help designing the model. So, here, we have to add differential equations without pushing forward and using fataly "humidity transitions of home rooms" ! We will have something more abstract. 
Maybe there are ways to use or test the solution with FPGA algoriithm. see: this : https://github.com/search?q=fpga&type=repositories
AS I already created a new programming langage in another repository, make sure this langage runs with this cells. Oh ! Fortunately, if I can say that, this seems to be another advanced graphic engine ! Ahahahahahahahaha ! You can surely mix it with mitsuba graphic engine for non realtime rendering. I mean another graphic engine. Fully suited for it.
so see: https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/mitsuba
So, what measures can we take for the architecture sculpting ? I already did some things in metals sculpting and finished with ceramics and log(x). You can also use this formula : L * E <= .... or L * E >=... to add electrical support.
This study may help having a cutting edge solution that resist time over years. Everything to let this architecture the best :

It was done by scratch. Try to find a common view of cells architectures.
As this is one of the latest response to a mathematical problem suited for a range of other problems, this can be used as a cheater probe in chess. Everything is approximate. I'm still not completely sure.
