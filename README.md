Supercomputer cells architecture 1

we can start with : exp(2980x) = ln(20y) because maths are large scale world and with this formula, we can extend something simple to a next corresponding complicated form of maths. I hope that there is ways. At the moment, I don't know which way I can use. I used to many times physics then I hope to use pure maths too or physics fatally. May be used as CGI tools ! Then, with that knowledge, it is sure that we can use local models because I used models in my first chess engine (the one which doesn't use a supercomputer cell).I don't know what is local models but, so, non verified models with log(x) can help designing the model. So, here, we have to add differential equations without pushing forward and using fataly "humidity transitions of home rooms" ! We will have something more abstract.
